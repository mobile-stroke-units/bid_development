# Ideas for modelling

## Include in bid

* Model effect of:
    1) Current practice drip-and-ship
    2) MSU
    3) Pre-hospital diagnostic
   
* Model outcome based on time to IVT & MT:
    * Model by mRS breakdown and shift in mRS
    * Analyse by net effect and variation (improving/worsening of equity of outcome)
    
* Model effect on:
    * Patients (by stroke type and treatment, including mimics)
    * Ambulance services
    * Hospital (admissions, beds?)
   
* Large scale geographic model (provides maximum possible effect of MSU - assume no capacity limitation) for all of England. MSU home locations based from:
    1) Comprehensive stroke units (currently providing IVT + MT)
    2) Emergency stroke units (currently providing IVT)
    3) All acute hospitals (about 170 hospitals)
    
* Model England and Wales

* Discrete Event Simulation for regional modelling:
    * 1 urban + 1 rural
    * MSU with capacity constraints
    
* Allow for demographic changes

## Key research questions

1. Compared with current practice, or with emerging pre-hospital stroke type diagnostics, where in England and Wales are Mobile Stroke Units likely to lead to a significant reduction in disability outcomes due to faster reperfusion (either from on-sceene thrombolysis, or improved direction of suitable patients to units providing mechanical thrombectomy)?

2. What are the likely consequences to patients, ambulance services, and acute stroke units
on implementation of mobile stroke units? How do these effects break down by stroke type (including mimics).

3. What are the costs of implementing Mobile Stroke Units. Where (if anywhere) is implementation of Mobile Stroke Units likely to be cost-effective.

4. How will Mobile Stroke Units likely effect equity of access to (and therefore outcome from) emergency stroke care?
