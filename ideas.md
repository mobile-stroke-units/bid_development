# Ideas for modelling

## Include in bid

* Model effect of:
    1) Current practice drip-and-ship
    2) MSU
    3) Pre-hospital diagnostic
   
* Model outcome based on time to IVT & MT:
    * Model by mRS breakdown and shift in mRS
    * Analyse by net effect and variation (improving/worsening of equity of outcome)
    
* Model effect on:
    * Patients (by stroke type and treatment, including mimics)
    * Ambulance services
    * Hospital (admissions, beds?)
   
* Large scale geographic model (provides maximum possible effect of MSU - assume no capacity limitation) for all of England. MSU home locations based from:
    1) Comprehensive stroke units (currently providing IVT + MT)
    2) Emergency stroke units (currently providing IVT)
    3) All acute hospitals (about 170 hospitals)
    
* Model England and Wales

* Discrete Event Simulation for regional modelling:
    * 1 urban + 1 rural
    * MSU with capacity constraints
    
* Allow for demographic changes
